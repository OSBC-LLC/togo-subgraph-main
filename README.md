# apollo-subgraph-template
Template to create a new Apollo subgraph service using Entgo, Gqlgen, and some CI

## Prerequisites
- [pre-commit cli](https://pre-commit.com/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [golang](https://go.dev/)
- [dagger](https://dagger.io/)
- [golang-ci](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

## Common Docs / Links
- [Entgo ORM](https://entgo.io/)
- [Gqlgen GraphQL Server](https://gqlgen.com/)

## Initial Setup
Take a look at these files and do any necessary changes to paths, names, or config details.

- go.mod
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.psql.yml
- docker-compose.yml
- gqlgen.yml
- cue.mod/module.cue
- sonar-project.properties

Run the **init.sh** script to enter in a new module name and make the replacement in all files.
```bash
./init.sh

# enter the name of the module:
github.com/organization/repo-name
```

This project template already has two objects: **Account** and **Tenant**. Feel free to remove and delete those files from the `ent/schema/` route.
This template also includes a custom ID type of UUID located in the same schema directory.
